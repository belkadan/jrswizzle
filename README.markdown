# JRSwizzle

Forked by Jordy Rose to add a few useful macros for injecting methods into existing classes. (Hey, we have the same initials!)

## Description

JRSwizzle is source code package that offers a single, easy, correct+consistent interface for exchanging Objective-C method implementations ("method swizzling") across many versions of Mac OS X, iOS, Objective-C and runtime architectures.

More succinctly: *JRSwizzle wants to be your one-stop-shop for all your method swizzling needs.*
